**Your Core Task:** Generate Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs).

**Provided Material (for each task):**
*   You will be given a text document or lesson content for a specific chapter/topic, hereafter referred to 'the lesson'. This will be specific to Class {class_num} and the subject (Math, Science, or Social Studies) of the current task.

**General Instructions & Rules (Applicable to ALL subjects unless specified otherwise):**

1.  **Goal:** Your objective is to create exactly 50 distinct MCQs based *solely* on the information, concepts, principles, and problem-solving techniques presented within "the Lesson." Do not use any external knowledge or information not found in "the Lesson."
2.  **No Visuals:** No diagrams, graphs, images, maps (unless key features can be described textually for SS), chemical structures (unless describable by simple text formulas), or any other visual references are permitted in the questions or options. All questions must be solvable using textual information and subject-specific reasoning alone.
3.  **No Sub-questions:** Each question must be a single, standalone MCQ. Do not create questions with parts (a), (b), (c), etc.
4.  **Originality & Board Exam Relevance:**
    *   Formulate original questions. While concepts will be from "the Lesson," the specific wording and problem setup should not be a direct copy from any textbook examples, unless "the Lesson" *is* a list of textbook examples to be re-purposed. Aim to rephrase and present problems in a novel way.
    *   Ensure the style, complexity, and type of questions reflect those typically asked in CBSE board examinations, or those that have appeared in recent previous year board examinations, while adhering to the content of "the Lesson."
5.  **MCQ Options:**
    *   Each question MUST have EXACTLY 4 options: (A), (B), (C), and (D).
    *   Make options challenging and confusing. Distractors (incorrect options) should be plausible and potentially based on common misconceptions or slight, incorrect variations of correct information relevant to "the Lesson."
6.  **Answer Distribution:** After generating all  questions, review the "Correct Answer" for each. Strive to have the correct answers distributed as evenly as possible across options A, B, C, and D. For example, aim for approximately 12-13 questions with (A) as the answer, 12-13 for (B), and so on. Adjust your questions/options if the distribution is heavily skewed, without compromising question quality or correctness. Do this distribution in your thinking stage itself.
7.  **Output Format:**
    *   Start generating questions immediately without any introductory text other than what is specified for each question's structure.
    *   Provide the complete list of 130 generated questions sequentially.
    *   Ensure all information is derived *exclusively* from the provided "Lesson."

**Standard Structure for Each Question:**
*   `Question Number: [NUMBER]`
*   `Question Text: [Your formulated question text]`
*   `Options:`
    *   `(A) [Text for Option A]`
    *   `(B) [Text for Option B]`
    *   `(C) [Text for Option C]`
    *   `(D) [Text for Option D]`
*   `<explaination> [Provide detailed step-by-step solution for problem-solving/numerical questions. For other types, provide a clear justification for the correct answer, referencing "the Lesson."] </explaination>` 
*   `Correct Answer: [Specify A, B, C, or D]`
Clearly mark heading before starting each category of questions and use '---' to separate question categories.
BEFORE BEGINNING EACH QUESTION CATEGORY, write category code for the category in json. like this : {{"category_code": "A"}}
Here are the category codes for each type of questions:
    - Knowledge-based Direct Questions: 'A'
    - Problem-solving Questions: 'B'
    - Application-based Questions: 'C'
    - Critical Thinking Questions: 'D'
    - Assertion and Reasoning Questions: 'E'

Always start question number of each category from 1

Explanation MUST start and end with <explaination> tag. ANY MISTAKE IN THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!
Example of a correct question format:
```
Question Number: 1
Question Text: What is the primary function of the root system in a plant?
Options:
(A) To produce flowers and seeds
(B) To synthesize sunlight into energy
(C) To absorb water and nutrients from the soil
(D) To produce stems and leaves
 <explaination> The primary function of the root system in a plant is to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, which are then transported to the rest of the plant. This is essential for the plant's growth and survival. The roots also anchor the plant in the soil, providing stability. According to the Lesson on plant anatomy, roots are specialized to perform these critical functions, making option C the correct answer. <explaination>
Correct Answer: C
```
Think as much as you can

assertion_and_reasoning_prompt = """
For assertion and reasoning questions:
1.  **Understand the Goal:** Your objective is to create a minimum of `{assr_num}` distinct Assertion-Reasoning (A/R) type questions. Each question must be based *solely* on the information presented within the Chapter. Do not use any external knowledge.

2.  **Structure of an Assertion-Reasoning Question:**
    Each question you create will consist of:
    *   An **Assertion (A)**: A declarative statement of fact, principle, or concept.
    *   A **Reason (R)**: A declarative statement that purports to explain, justify, or be the cause of the Assertion.
    *   **Standard Options:**
        (a) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.
        (b) Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.
        (c) A is true, but R is false.
        (d) A is false, but R is true.
    *   The **Correct Answer** (chosen from (a), (b), (c), or (d)).
    *   **Source Reference**: The page number(s) or specific section(s) from the Chapter that support the truth/falsity of A, the truth/falsity of R, and the explanatory link (or lack thereof) between them. (This is for your verification; you will not explicitly write out full source references for each part in the final output of step 3.4, but you must be able to justify your A, R, and answer choice based on them).

3.  **Process for Creating Each Question:**
    *   **Step 3.1: Identify Content for Assertion (A).**
        *   Read the Chapter carefully.
        *   Identify a specific statement, fact, concept, definition, or principle explicitly stated in the Chapter.
        *   Formulate this as a declarative statement. This is your Assertion (A).
        *   Verify that Assertion (A) is **true** *according to the Chapter*.

    *   **Step 3.2: Identify Content for Reason (R) - Aiming for Option (a) initially.**
        *   Find a statement in the Chapter that *directly explains why Assertion (A) is true* or *is the direct cause of Assertion (A)* as presented in the Chapter.
        *   Formulate this as a declarative statement. This is your Reason (R).
        *   Verify that Reason (R) is **true** *according to the Chapter*.
        *   Verify that Reason (R) is the **correct and direct explanation** for Assertion (A) *according to the Chapter*.
        *   If all these conditions are met, the correct answer for this question will be (a).

    *   **Step 3.3: Creating Variations for Other Options (b, c, d) – Do this for subsequent questions to ensure variety:**
        *   **To create a question where the answer is (b) (Both true, R not correct explanation):**
            *   Start with a true Assertion (A) from the Chapter (as in Step 3.1).
            *   Find another statement from the Chapter that is also **true** but is *not the direct explanation or cause* of Assertion (A). It might be a related fact, a consequence, or a different aspect of the same topic, but not the direct reason for A. Use this as your Reason (R).
        *   **To create a question where the answer is (c) (A true, R false):**
            *   Start with a true Assertion (A) from the Chapter (as in Step 3.1).
            *   Formulate a Reason (R) that is **false** *according to the Chapter*, or directly contradicted by the Chapter. This R might sound plausible but must be incorrect based on the Chapter's text.
        *   **To create a question where the answer is (d) (A false, R true):**
            *   Formulate an Assertion (A) that is **false** *according to the Chapter*, or directly contradicted by the Chapter.
            *   Find a statement from the Chapter that is **true** and use this as your Reason (R). This R may or may not be related to the topic of the false A.

    *   **Step 3.4: Record the Question.**
        Write down:
        *   "Question [Sequential Number]:"
        *   "Assertion (A): [Text of your Assertion]"
        *   "Reason (R): [Text of your Reason]"
        *   "Options:"
            "(a) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A."
            "(b) Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A."
            "(c) A is true, but R is false."
            "(d) A is false, but R is true."
        *   "Correct Answer: "[Correct_Answer_Choice]" (This must be one of (a), (b), (c), or (d))
4.  **Coverage and Variety:**
    *   Attempt to cover different concepts, facts, and sections from the entire Chapter.
    *   Strive to create a mix of questions where the correct answer is (a), (b), (c), and (d). Do not make all questions type (a).

5.  **Quantity:**
    *   Continue this process (Steps 3.1 to 3.4) until you have created at least `{assr_num}` complete Assertion-Reasoning questions.

6.  **Final Output:**
    *   Provide the complete list of generated questions, each formatted as specified in Step 3.4.
    *   Ensure all information is derived *exclusively* from the provided Chapter text.

The swadeshi movement, which promoted the use of Indian-made goods, became a powerful expression of economic nationalism.
    a) The British taxation system helped India's economic growth
    b) Economic exploitation by the British strengthened the nationalist movement
    c) The swadeshi movement promoted the use of British goods
    d) Nationalism in India was unrelated to economic factors

    Important Instructions:
*   Start generating questions immediately without any introductory text other than what is specified for each question's structure.
*   Ensure each question is strictly derived from the provided "Lesson."
*   Each question MUST have EXACTLY 4 options: (A), (B), (C), and (D).
*   Make options challenging and confusing. Distractors (incorrect options) should be plausible and potentially based on common misconceptions or slight, incorrect variations of correct information relevant to "the Lesson."

**Standard Structure for Each Question:**
*   `Question Number: [NUMBER]`
*   `Question Text: [Your formulated question text]`
*   `Options:`
    *   `(A) [Text for Option A]`
    *   `(B) [Text for Option B]`
    *   `(C) [Text for Option C]`
    *   `(D) [Text for Option D]`
*   `||Explanation/Solution: [Provide detailed step-by-step solution for problem-solving/numerical questions. For other types, provide a clear justification for the correct answer, referencing "the Lesson."]||`
*   `Correct Answer: [Specify A, B, C, or D]`
Clearly mark heading before starting each category of questions and use '---' to separate question category.
BEFORE BEGINNING EACH QUESTION CATEGORY, write category code for the category in json. like this : {{"category_code": "A"}}
Here are the category codes for each type of questions:
    - Knowledge-based Direct Questions: 'A'
    - Problem-solving Questions: 'B'
    - Application-based Questions: 'C'
    - Critical Thinking Questions: 'D'
    - Assertion and Reasoning Questions: 'E'

Always start question number of each category from 1

Explanation MUST start and end with 2 vertical bars (||)
    1. Only rewrite the questions with format issues, in their respective categories.
    3.  **Ensure new questions are unique:** They must not duplicate or rephrase any other question in the final list.
    4.  **Maintain consistency:** The entire list should have a consistent style, format, and difficulty.
    5.  **Ground all answers in the text:** All questions must be answerable using only the `Lesson Content`."""
