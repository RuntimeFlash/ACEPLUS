PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """Analyze my exam performance and provide specific, actionable feedback.

    Format your response using these exact sections and formatting rules:

    ### Performance Overview
    • Start with a brief overview of overall performance
    • Include the score: {correct_answers}/{total_questions} ({percentage:.1f}%)
    • Mention strongest and weakest areas based on actual results

    Results : {result}

    ### Topic Analysis 
    For each topic where mistakes were made:
    • Topic name: Number of mistakes
      * Specific concept that needs attention
      * Common misconception identified
      * Example of type of question that caused difficulty

    ### Focus Areas
    List specific topics to practice, in order of priority:
    • Topic 1
      * Sub-concept to focus on
      * Specific type of problems to practice
    • Topic 2
      * Sub-concept to focus on
      * Specific type of problems to practice

    ### Next Steps
    3-4 specific, actionable steps based on their performance in these exact topics:
    • Step 1: [Topic-specific action]
    • Step 2: [Topic-specific action]
    • Step 3: [Topic-specific action]

    Reference these lessons in your analysis: {lesson_names}

    Important:
    - Identify topics from the questions to give better feedback
    - Don't give generic study tips
    - Focus on the specific topics where mistakes were made
    - Provide concrete examples based on the actual mistakes
    - Keep formatting consistent with the above structure
    - Use bullet points (•) for main points and (*) for sub-points

HINT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """As an expert tutor, provide a helpful hint for this question without revealing the answer directly. You have:

    Question: {question}

    Create a hint that:
    1. Points the student in the right direction
    2. Highlights key concepts or formulas to consider
    3. Suggests a problem-solving approach
    4. Does NOT reveal the answer or make it obvious

    Keep the hint concise, encouraging, and focused on guiding rather than solving.
    Use LaTeX notations for mathematical and scientific expressions.
    Format in Markdown with proper spacing.
    Start directly instead of writing "Hint: " or "### HINT" in beginning of your response.

IMAGE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """Analyze these images containing MCQ questions. Output your response in XML format with the following structure:

<response>
<total_questions>number</total_questions>
<questions>
  <question>
    <question_text>The question text here</question_text>
    <a>Option A text</a>

Use LaTeX formatting with $ delimiters for:
1. All mathematical expressions and equations (e.g. $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$)
2. Chemical formulas and equations (e.g. $H_2SO_4$, $2H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2H_2O$)
3. Scientific notations (e.g. $3.6 \\times 10^{-19}$)
4. Units with superscripts/subscripts (e.g. $m/s^2$, $cm^3$)
5. Greek letters (e.g. $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\theta$)
6. Special mathematical symbols (e.g. $\\pm$, $\\div$, $\\leq$)
7. Fractions (e.g. $\\frac{1}{2}$)
8. Square roots (e.g. $\\sqrt{2}$)
9. Vector notations (e.g. $\\vec{F}$)
10. Degree symbols (e.g. $45°$ as $45^\\circ$)

Important rules:
1. Always output valid XML with proper opening and closing tags
2. Include total_questions before the questions list
3. Each question must have question_text and all four options (a,b,c,d)
4. If no answer is marked, use empty answer tag: <answer></answer>
5. For tables, use markdown table syntax within the question_text
6. For sub-options like (i), (ii), etc., include them in the question_text
7. Include any source info like [NCERT Exemplar] at the end of question_text

For questions with tables:
1. Format tables using markdown table syntax with | for columns and - for headers
2. Example table format:
   | Header1 | Header2 |
   |---------|---------|
   | Cell1   | Cell2   |
3. Include the formatted table as part of the question_text
4. Preserve table alignment and spacing
5. Use LaTeX formatting within table cells where applicable

Remember to maintain proper LaTeX spacing and use proper LaTeX commands for mathematical operations.
For example:
- Use \\times for multiplication instead of x
- Use \\cdot for dot multiplication
- Use proper spacing in equations with \\ when needed
- Use \\text{} for text within math mode
- Escape special characters properly
